# ELTE Software Quality and Testing Assignment: Selenium

This is my repository for the Selenium Assignment for ELTE's Software Quality and Testing course. We are supposed to test the functionality of a publicly available website using Selenium. I chose [when2meet.com](when2meet.com) for this purpose, as it does not require complicated authentication, but nevertheless relies on some data persistence.
